    *update about last month follows, today blogging only about yesterday and today*
        It is very nice to experience hoe much we have learned, but I also enjoy (on another level) experiencing the frustration when something doesn't work.
        Because it gives me the anticipation about what is out there, still waiting for me to learn.
        Yesterday we talked about how to continue the apprenticeship. Where will we go from here? We talked about switching our focus to Java soon.
        But, because we still have 2 meetups about TDD coming, and we will be using JavaScript there, we will keep on focussing on JavaScript for now.
        Yesterday we learned about the DOM and how this is used to let JavaScript communicate with the browser/HTML.
        We added a scoreboard to our "visualiser.js" and got the browser to show this and to updat the score after each given point.
        Our homework is to also let the visualiser generate the memory board.
        Because of the holiday this week, I got to work on in this morning already. It was hard to stop.. but my children also want some attention.
        I learned a lot by doing this. In the morning, with a fresh mind! And am proud that I solved the problems I encountered by my own.

        Working on my own today on the assignment, and having the TDD experience from the last two meetups, made me feel I want to work more test-driven.
        I didn't do it though, because continuing writing code and using the console to do the test was too tempting at this moment.

        The last few weeks we started learning javascript. The current goal is to make our memory game work. Every week we learn a little bit more
        so the game develops together with our skills in javascript.
        Thus far we learned about </p>
        <ul style="color:black; background-color: #669999;">
        <li> - object oriented programming, what are objects, how to access them</li>
        <li> - using this, var, </li>
        <li> - if/else , for loops</li>
        <li> - working with arrays</li>
        <li> - private and public objects</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The game works in the console of the browser for now. A player can choose two cards, the game checks if the cards are still on the table,
        if the cards are turned upside down ans if the cards are the samen. If two cards are the same, the player can play again and the cards are removed from the table.
        If the cards are different, the game switches to the other player. For now it is not possible to assign a score to the players.
        The homework for our next meeting is to make it possible to visualise the gameplay in the browser. I have been working on this for the past  evenings.
        It still isn't clear enough for me how to do it, so I hope I will learn more tomorrow.
        <br>
        I still enjoy learning everything very much. At one hand I am proud to see how much I've already learned in the past few weeks, at the other hand I get frustrated
        about how much effort it costs me to grasp what I am doing and how to continue in the programme. The frustration is a positieve felling, though.
        It shows me I am developing myself and I am really learning. I underestimated how difficult it is to combine this learning with running a family and having a job
        that takes my attention during daytime. So all the learning I do, I have to do in the evening, after the kids are asleep and when my head is already a bit tired.
        I think I can be proud of the progress I make nonetheless.

        Last week 1 watched some youtube video's on how to use Sourcetree to work togehter with GitHub and to push de changes made locally (in IntelliJ) to my website.
        Today I encountered some conflicts while pushing and pulling. After Marco got me back on track (thanks!!), I added navigation to my index.html and made some changes in memory.html.
        Still not satisfied about the layout of my memory tiles, but it is time for bed now. This week I will work on the layout of the rest of my memory.html. After the visual (HTML & CSS)
        part of the game is done, we will learn how to make the game work.. For now, it is only the visual part of the game. </p>

        Second lesson at "cursuscentrum Marco" <br> starting to design a page for the memory game we are learning to develop.
        Using grids and bootstrap. How do the programmes Marco advised work together, which part do I use to do what.
        Felling myself very "bewust onbekwaam" but loving it, I am learning and I see I have a lot te learn. </p>

        First lesson at "cursuscentrum Marco" Today I worked on clearing my page from the generated HTML and CSS codes and define the content ans layout of my page myself.
        starting to get to know CSS and how to tell the browser where to look. And also learning which programmes to use to write the code.
        Most important lesson: this is NOT notepad ;) </p>

        My first steps back into coding.
        Under the great and supportive supervision of my dear friend Marco (<a href="https://github.com/McBeelen" class="user-mention">@McBeelen</a>).
        Today I created my GitHub page using the automatic generator.
        Just to find out how it works.
        My goal is to code myself, and use as little generators as needed.</p>
